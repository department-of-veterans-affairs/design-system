The components that make up Vets.gov's pattern library should all be documented in Jean Pants. You can access each component using the navigation to the left.

## Component Preview

Each component is rendered in Fractal in a small preview window, but it's also available as a full-screen preview without interference from the system's UI. Click the blue icon to the right of the component's name to see this view.

Each component has a few key pieces of information associated with it, located in the upper-right corner of the UI or in the tabs beneath the visual demo.

### The label

Jean Pants has four labels that can be applied to each component:

- **Ready**: Implement at will. This component is mature and well-developed.
- **WIP**: This component can be implemented on Vets.gov (it may already have been), but may still be in active development. Proceed with caution.
- **Prototype**: This is the "kitchen sink" label -- components with this label are experimental. Do not implement on Vets.gov without consulting with its author!
- **Deprecated**: Components with this label are on their way out; they're still in the system for historical purposes. Do not implement.

### Notes

Driven by a component's README file, notes can contain documentation, historical knowledge, or context for using this component.

### Props

Specific to React components, this tab contains all the component's properties and the information you need to use them.

### HTML

The HTML rendering of a given component. If you need to use a component in static content instead of in a React context, use this tab to get your code.

### View, Context, & Info

These three tabs are specific to Fractal (the software that underpins JP).

- The **View** is the Nunjucks template code for the component that renders it within Fractal.
- The **Context** is the contents of a component's config file, and shows the variables being passed into the Fractal render.
- The **Info** is each component's file information within the context of Fractal -- its handle, variants, path within the filesystem, and which templates reference it. This is helpful if you're modifying a component and need to know where to find the Fractal code!
