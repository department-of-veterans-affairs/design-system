-  It's clear who the page/section is for by glancing at the title, visuals, or introductory text.
-  The main message is stated at the beginning (at or near the top of the page).



## Literacy

-  Uses a conversational voice, including contractions where appropriate.
-  Uses active rather than passive voice (unless there's a darn good reason to use passive).
-  Uses short, simple sentences and paragraphs.
-  Uses simple, plain-language words (for example, "find" instead of "locate" and "get" instead of "obtain").
-  Material focuses on need-to-know information only.
-  Uses language that the audience uses, avoiding unnecessary jargon and providing plain-language definitions for terms and acronyms that are likely to be unfamiliar.
-  Uses pronouns: "I" when the user asks a question; "you" when we answer the question and in general to address the user (rather than "Servicemember" and "Veteran"); and "we" to refer to VA.
-  Uses numerals for all numbers. Does not spell out any numbers.
-  Uses "to" instead of an en dash for ranges. ("6 to 8 weeks" or  "8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.)



## Calls to Action

-  Includes at least 1 call to action.
-  Breaks the action down into concrete steps.



## Linking Conventions

-  Breaks out links whenever possible (rather than embedding links in the text).
-  Avoids "Read more," "Learn more," "See more," and "Click here" as stand-alone general link phrases.
-  Links the relevant words, starting with keywords or actionable words. But doesn't link only the names of forms or other pages (so, avoid linking only "eBenefits"-make the link language more active).
-  Length of embedded links: 5-8 words. Doesn't link entire sentences.
-  Length of set-apart links: Entire sentences or phrases.



## Layout and Typography

-  Content is organized in chunks with headings.
-  Uses bulleted or numbered lists when appropriate, with no more than 7 items per list.
-  The page's design and layout are clear, uncluttered, and easy to follow.
