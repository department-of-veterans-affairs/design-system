### Learn how to:
- Change ownership
- Check off your task
- Upload Word docs and alert the next person in the workflow

### Which stories are assigned to me? (What do I own?)
In Pivotal, one web page of content is called a "story." To search for stories that are assigned to you, find the search box in the top right part of the screen. The box says, "Search project." Click in the box and type, with no spaces, owner:"yourpivotalname"

Press Enter. You will see all the stories assigned to you in the column on the far right.

**You can also search for a specific story by typing the name of the story into the search box (the name is all that's needed; no quotation marks).**

#### 1. Expand a story.

Make status updates and upload new versions of the Word doc associated with this story. To expand, click on the small, triangular arrow that points at the star.

#### 2. Change ownership to whomever is next in the process.

Once you have expanded the story, go to the row called OWNERS and click on the plus sign to the right of your name. A list of people will show up. Scroll down to find the name of whomever is next in the process. Click on the name. The initials of that person will show up in that OWNERS row next to your name.

Now remove yourself as an owner by clicking on your name or your initials and then clicking the red REMOVE button.

Click in the appropriate box and a check mark will appear.

#### 4. Upload your version of the Word doc, alert whomever is next in the process, and leave a message or instructions for what should happen next.

Scroll down to the bottom of the ACTIVITY section. Below your name, you'll see a white "Add a comment" box. Type the @ symbol and a pop-up list of names will appear below the comment box. Click on the name of the person to whom you are handing off ownership. When you do, their handle will appear in the box. Immediately following their handle, you can type a note, comment, or question.

Then click on the paperclip located under the comment box. Find the file you need to upload and click Open. This uploads the doc to Pivotal.

Click the Add button to save your comments and uploaded file to Pivotal. When you click Add, Pivotal sends the person who is next in the process an e-mail notification.
