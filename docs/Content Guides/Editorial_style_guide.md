### Vets.gov voice and tone

**Voice** is the style, or personality, of a communication. The vets.gov voice should be consistent across all our communications. The vets.gov voice is direct, transparent, dedicated, and human. It’s that of a trusted advocate — ready with information, advice, and updates.

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Direct</th>
<th>Transparent</th>
<th>Dedicated</th>
<th>Human</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>confident</td>
<td>clear</td>
<td>consistent</td>
<td>accessible</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>decisive</td>
<td>open</td>
<td>supportive</td>
<td>friendly</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>honest</td>
<td>informed</td>
<td>undaunted</td>
<td>genuine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pragmatic</td>
<td>trustworthy</td>
<td>driven by a purpose</td>
<td>inclusive</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>not extraneous</td>
<td>forthcoming</td>
<td>ready to serve</td>
<td>conversational</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>tireless</td>
<td>caring</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Not:</strong> Abrupt, arrogant, bossy, cold, critical, condescending.</td>
<td><strong>Not:</strong> Overly complex, in the weeds, too much information, technical.</td>
<td><strong>Not:</strong> Obligated, demanding, relentless.</td>
<td><strong>Not:</strong> Superficial, gimmicky, overly casual.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

**Tone** is the mood of the writing. The tone may vary based on the material’s content, the context, and the reader’s likely emotional state. For example, content on starting a vocational training program needs to have a more upbeat, encouraging tone, while content on burials needs a more gentle, compassionate tone. 	

#### Voice

Balance the voice between friendly and formal — sound approachable and supportive. When possible, use first person (we, us, our) and second person (you, your) pronouns. Avoid judgmental or condescending language.

Use plain language. For example:
- Use contractions ("don't" rather than "do not").
- Avoid passive voice.

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Passive</th>
<th>Active</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Most homeless services are run locally.</td>
<td>Local organizations run most homeless services.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All benefits decisions can be appealed.</td>
<td>You can appeal any decision VA makes about your benefits.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

- Choose common words, like “help” instead of “assist” and “happen” instead of “occur” (see the table below of words to avoid for more details).
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short.
  - Aim for sentences that are 15 words or fewer, but know that longer sentences are sometimes necessary.
  - Aim for sentences that have only 1 main message.
  - Use simple sentence construction (brevity wins!), and consider what information really needs to be included, for example:

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Too wordy/too much information</th>
<th>Short and sweet</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>After the download is complete, double click on the file and it should open as long as you have the necessary software on your computer.</td>
<td>Double click on the downloaded file to open it.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

In the example below, we’ve used active voice, shorter sentences and paragraphs, and common words like “payments” instead of “compensation” to create a more conversational voice.

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Before</th>
<th>After</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Disability compensation is a key benefit that helps Veterans. VA disability compensation provides monthly benefits to address the effects of disabilities, diseases, or injuries incurred during active military service. Some may not be apparent until years after you have completed your service. A disability can apply to physical conditions, such as chronic knee pain, as well as mental-health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</td>
<td>Do you have a lasting disability because you got hurt or sick during active service? You may be able to get monthly disability payments (benefits).<br><br><p>We offer benefits to help Veterans with different kinds of disabilities. You could have a physical problem, like knee pain that doesn’t go away. Or you might have a mental health condition, like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some disabilities may not develop until years after you finished your service.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

#### Tone

Be careful about sounding harsh or intimidating. Even if you’re addressing a serious topic, plain language and a direct tone can convey the required seriousness without being overwhelming or confusing.

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Before</th>
<th>After</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>When filing your claim, you should submit evidence that the additional disability occurred as a result of VA medical care, or from participation in VA vocational rehabilitation or compensated work-therapy programs. The additional disability cannot be a reasonably expected result of or complication from treatment.</td>
<td>When you file your claim, you will need to give us evidence that you became more disabled because of VA medical care or another VA program, like job training or a work-therapy program.<br><br><p>If you became more disabled because of something that normally happens with treatment, like a side effect or common complication, you won’t be able to get these benefits.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>



## Word Choice

Always use common words that Veterans will understand. If a term may be unfamiliar but you need to use it, be sure to give a plain-language definition.

**Note:** Veterans aren’t the only ones visiting vets.gov — their spouses, children, and other family members may also be looking for information about VA benefits and services. Consider defining military jargon terms that may be familiar to Veterans, but not to their dependents.

There are 3 tables below that will help us make plain-language word choices. The first lists words to avoid in vets.gov communications. The second lists words to use sparingly. The third lists words that should be defined. If a word needs to be defined, do so the first time you use it on a web page or as part of a form. After you’ve defined the word, use it without defining it again.

If the definition is short, put it in parentheses next to the word it defines, for example:
"If you don’t agree with the VBA’s decision, you can appeal to the Board for a de novo (new look) review."

If the definition is long, define the word in a separate sentence, for example:
"If you can’t work because of a service-connected disability, you may be able to get the same benefits as a 100% disabled Veteran, regardless of your rating. This is called being individually unemployable."

In some cases, you may want to introduce your reader to a complicated word because they are likely to encounter it elsewhere. In those cases, you can treat the more complicated word as the “definition,” but use a simpler word throughout your communications.

## Terms

### A

- active duty: Hyphenate when it modifies a noun; do not cap (active-duty Servicemember)
- accredited representative: Lowercase.
- Armed Forces: Capitalize.

### B

- beneficiary: Avoid this term in favor of “family member” when appropriate.
- Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program: “Benefits” is plural.


### C

- can vs. may: Use "can" when meaning the ability or power to do something; use "may" when meaning the permission to do it.
- Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD214)
- certifying official (VA certifying official)
- character of service (more casually referred to as "type of service"): This is a "block" or box on the DD214 that states one of the following: honorable, general/under honorable conditions, under other than honorable conditions, uncharacterized, or bad conduct.
- claim exam: This is the C&amp;P exam. The correct way to refer to it is "VA claim exam."
- click: Avoid using this word (especially the phrase "click here") to prompt users to click on a link; instead link the appropriate words. For example: “Find an <a href="https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/help/index.html">accredited representative</a> to help you.” or “Learn more about <a href="https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/claims-process/evidence/">evidence requirements</a>.”


### D

- deceased: Favor this word over "decedent," which is chiefly a legal term.
- Department of Veterans Affairs (no apostrophe)
- Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program (also called Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program): Both terms are regularly shortened to DEA.
- decision notice: We should _not_ refer to this as the "decision letter." The Veteran undergoes a VA claim exam (casually referred to as a C&amp;P exam), and then after VA reviews the evidence, they sent the Veteran a "decision notice" that includes the disability rating.


### E

- email: No hyphen.
- education (serving as an attributive noun to modify another noun)

  - education benefits: not educational benefits</li>
  - education and training opportunities</li>

  - educational counseling
    - educational and career counseling (this instance runs counter to the style within eBenefits &gt; Apply &gt; Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits &gt; Education and Career Counseling, but aligns with VR&amp;E Chapter 36 (Educational and Vocational Counseling)
    - educational and vocational counseling (to be consistent with VR&amp;E Chapter 36: Educational and Vocational Counseling)

- educational institution
- educational plan
- educational program
- Exception: Used to call special attention to something. It should be bolded and never in all caps.

### G

- GI: no periods (_not_ G.I.).
- GI Bill Comparison Tool: Capitalize "Comparison Tool."

In addition, the following related words do appear in Merriam-Webster as one: graveside and gravestone.)
- guarantee: Can be used as either a noun or a verb. For our purposes, especially within the Home Loans section, when used in a legal context, we use “guarantee” as a verb and “guaranty” as a noun. (“VA guarantees a portion of the loan.”)
- guaranty: Should be used only as a noun. (“Because of VA’s partial guaranty, lenders may offer better loan terms for Veterans.”)
- Guardsman/Guardsmen

- Note: Used to call special attention to something. It is bolded and never in all caps.
- number: Spell out this word rather than using "No." or "#."


### O

### P

- percent: Use the symbol % rather than spelling it out, for scannability.
- post-9/11: We use the slash rather than the hyphen for 9/11 (_not_ 9-11). For example, Post-9/11 GI Bill.
- postservice: No hyphen.

- preseparation: No hyphen.
- preservice: No hyphen.
- prestabilization: No hyphen.

### Q

### R

- Reserve
- Reservist

### T

- TSGLI: Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection


### U

- U.S.: This takes periods.


### V

- VA health care facility
- VA medical center: "Medical Center" should only be capped if a specific name is included in the title. Don't shorten to "VA center."
- VA regional office: "Regional Office" should only be capped if a specific name is included in the title.

## Content and Structure

### Need to Know vs. Nice to Know

Need-to-know information answers specific questions or helps solve the user’s problems. <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/structure-the-content/">Always put this information first</a> — in the material as a whole and within sections. Key information that is buried with less crucial information can confuse users, or they might miss it altogether.

Save nice-to-know information for later on, or even better, cut it if it doesn’t help your audience understand or act on your main message. If you need to include background information, keep it brief.

### Calls to Action

When readers understand what action to take and how to take it, they’re more likely to act. Think about what action you want the reader to take:

- State the action clearly at or near the beginning of the page.
- Make it easy for the reader to take action.
- Briefly note the benefit of taking the action.

In the after example below, the heading is now a clear call to action, and the link to complete the action is more prominent. Always put the call to action early. If it’s later in the material — even just a few sentences — the user may never get to it.

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Before</th>
<th>After</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Compensation benefits for health problems</strong></td>
<td><strong>File a claim for disability benefits</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Veterans may file a claim for disability compensation for health problems they believe are related to exposure to Agent Orange during military service. VA decides these claims on a case-by-case basis and will notify applicants of our decision. To determine your eligibility, file a claim online <a href="https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/">here</a>.</td>
<td>Do you think you have health problems because you had contact with Agent Orange during your service? <a href="https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/">Apply online</a> to see if you can get monthly payments (benefits). We’ll consider your case carefully and let you know what we decide.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


### Examples

Examples can be helpful in clarifying difficult concepts. Use examples to explain math or address complex or unfamiliar terminology.

> **Example:**
> If you don’t pay your bill within 30 days, we’ll add a penalty (extra charge) to your next bill. The penalty is an extra 6% of what you owe.
>
> For example, if you had a bill of $200 and didn’t pay it within 30 days, your next bill would be for $212 (the original amount plus an extra 6%).


## Style and formatting


### Style elements

- ampersands: Do not use ampersands in headers and running text. Spell out “and.”  (Exception: VRE)
- bold: Use bold sparingly to draw the reader's attention to must-read information that can be a full sentence or two. Be careful not to overuse bold text within a single page--or across our pages generally--or it will lose its power of emphasis. (Use italics to emphasize a word or two within a sentence. See the italics entry.)
- days of the week and months: Spell out the days of the week and the names of months (Monday rather than Mon.; September rather than Sept.). If there are space constraints, abbreviate with Mon. and Sept. For help text, for instance, especially when it needs to fit into a box on the page, we often need to abbreviate as follows: Mon.‒Fri., 7:00 a.m.‒7:00 p.m. (CST), and Sat., 9:00 a.m.‒5:30 p.m. (CST). Use the en dash rather than the shorter-in-length hyphen to connect days of the week and months that are ranges.
- headers: Headline capitalization for the main title or name of the page. All subsequent subheads on that page should be sentence-style capitalization.
- italics: Use italics sparingly to emphasize a word or two in a sentence. Do not italicize an entire sentence as it is hard to read on the screen. (e.g., If you request the withdrawal before you receive notice that the appeal has been transferred to the Board, submit this statement to VBA.)
  - orange stripe header that concludes the breadcrumbs should be headline capped unless in the form of a question, in which case it is sentence capped. We are trying to avoid orange stripe headers in the form of a question, but occasionally it will be appropriate.</li>
- piano keys: The language on a piano key needs to match in some way the header on the page where you land. It doesn’t have to be an exact match, but should share key words at least. Piano keys can be in the form of a question, but we don’t normally have orange stripe headers in the form of a question. They can work well together.
- space between sentences: Use only one space between sentences. Use two spaces between bold lead-ins and text.
- time zones: Place the abbreviation in parentheses following the time. Use the following abbreviations for time zones:
  - EST: eastern standard time
  - MST: mountain standard time
  - CST: central standard time
  - PST: Pacific standard time
- Yes, if: This section is roman, not bold, and is followed by a colon.



### Numbers

- dates: Spell out the month rather than using numerals (except for 9/11). See the entry for "Days of the week and months."
- numbers: Use numerals for all numbers. Do not spell out any numbers.
- percentages: Use numerals rather than spelling out the number. Use the percentage symbol rather than the word “percent” (a combined disability rating of 70%) with no space between the numeral and the percent symbol. **Note:** vets.gov style deviates from 18F style for <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/numbers-and-percentages/">percentages</a>. We take this approach for scannability and because we have a fair amount of text discussing disability ratings in the Disability section. Both AP and Chicago Manual of Style recommend our approach for technical or scientific writing. Disability ratings fall into this category of writing.
- phone numbers: I have seen some exceptions that make sense, but in general, do not use parentheses for the area code. For 800 numbers, use 1 before the area code: 1-800-578-5777; for all other phone numbers that are not 800 numbers, the 1 should not be used: 401-283-3542.
- phone numbers with an extension: Use clear language like "press 1" rather than something more vague like "option 1" or "choose option 1." For example: Please call 877-222-VETS (8387), then press 2, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (EST).
- time/hours: Use numerals rather than spelling out the number. When indicating a time range, use the "from ... to" or "between ... and" construction (“6 to 8 weeks” or “8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.”). Where there are space constraints, such as in a box or an application, you may use the en dash, which is a little longer (--) than a hyphen or dash (-):
> Please call 800-123-4567 during business hours, 8:00 a.m.‒5:00 p.m. (EST)
> or
> Please call 800-123-4567 between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. (EST)

_Do not combine the two constructions_ to use “from” with the dash like this: “from 8:00‒5:00.”

- hours of operation associated with a phone number: Monday‒Friday, 7:00 a.m.‒7:00 p.m. (CST), and Saturday, 9:00 a.m.‒5:30 p.m. (CST). Spell out days of the week, if possible. If there's not enough room, use: Mon.‒Fri.



### Interface elements

(Adapted from the <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/technical-and-interface-writing/">"Technical and interface writing"</a> section of the 18F Content Guide.)

Guide the customer with words reflective of the interface. Take the customer step by step through the process. Be specific about what the customer needs to click on or choose from. Use clear, active verbs to tell readers how to interact with interface elements:

- _Choose_ from drop-down menus.
- _Select_ or _deselect_ checkboxes and radio buttons.
- _Click_ or _tap_ buttons.
- _Follow_ or _open_ links.



Emphasize the name of the interface label by making it bold:

In the **File** menu, choose **Save**.
Select **I agree**.
Click **Continue**.



In tools such as Résumé Builder and the Health Care Application, the boxes where Veterans enter information have descriptors above them identifying what information should be entered. For instance, "First name" and "Branch of service." Sentence cap these descriptors (so, not "First Name" and "Branch of Service").

### Punctuation


- bulleted lists: Bulleted lists are valuable tools in plain-language writing — they’re easy to scan and can help organize important information. If a sentence lists more than three items or elements, it is best to break the sentence out into a bulleted list. When using bulleted lists:
  - Capitalize the first word of every bullet.
  - Don’t use commas or semicolons after points in a bulleted list.
  - Don't use a period at the end of the bullet unless it is a complete sentence.
  - Don't use a bulleted list for only 1 element.
  - If your list has more than 7 items, use subheads to break it up.
  - Keep list items short (1 or 2 sentences in length)
  - Keep bullets in the same list parallel in construction (for example, each bullet starts with a verb) and consistent in style, grammar, and use of punctuation.

<td>Several military occupational specialties have a risk of exposure to asbestos, including mining, milling, shipyard work, insulation work, demolition of old buildings, carpentry, and construction. VA also recognizes a risk of exposure in the manufacturing and installation of flooring, roofing, cement sheet, and pipe products. If you served in one of these specialties, you should be tested for related health risks.</td>

> In the **After** example:
>
> - The header draws the reader in — it poses an important question that many readers will have.
> - The first sentence clearly outlines what the reader needs to know and the action they need to take.
> - Plain language creates a conversational tone — without complicated terms like “exposure” — while still conveying the seriousness of the subject.
> - Bullets make it easier for readers to see at a glance which occupations might have put them at risk.




- comma: Use the serial comma (sometimes referred to as the Oxford comma).
- exclamation point: We don't use the exclamation point since it does not align with the vets.gov tone, which is warm and quiet.




### Navigation language and conventions

- bread crumbs: This IA element shows the Veteran the path to the current page or where the page lives in the IA (not all pages follow a path). Bread crumb text should he headline capped.-
- linking (general guidance):
  - Avoid linking entire sentences or stand-alone phrases. </li>
  - Try not to link more than about 5 words. This is a general target, but there are times when linking more than 5 words makes sense (for instance, when we link to a specific form that has a long name): Fill out the <a href="http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-534-ARE.pdf">Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (VA Form 21-534)</a>.
    - **Too long:** The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans <a href="http://www.nchv.org/index.php/help/help/locate_organization/">lists by state all the women’s shelters available</a>.
    - **Relevant words linked:** The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans lists by state <a href="http://www.nchv.org/index.php/help/help/locate_organization/">all the women’s shelters available</a>.
  - Link the relevant words (usually this is more than a single word):
    - **Not meaningful:** VA maintains a <a href="http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/listcem.asp">list</a> of all the national and state VA cemeteries.
    - **Relevant words linked:** VA maintains a list of all the <a href="http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/listcem.asp">national and state VA cemeteries</a>.
  - If a string of words at the end of a sentence is linked, use punctuation (usually a period) as grammar would dictate, but do not link the ending punctuation (the period should not be underlined along with the rest of the link). E.g.: You have an <a href="https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/">Agent Orange‒related disability</a>.</li>
- external linking: Vets.gov uses an icon to alert Veterans, without being overly burdensome, that a link will take them to an external site. We don’t use a pop-up or a modal warning. This standard practice does not apply to external links in the vets.gov footer, where no icon accompanies the links to Twitter, Facebook, and other external pages.
  - An icon is autogenerated whenever there is a full link beginning with http, such as: <a href="http://vabenefits.vba.va.gov/vonapp/main.asp">http://vabenefits.vba.va.gov/vonapp/main.asp</a>
  - No icon will appear when a link is relative (one that begins with a forward slash followed by the vets.gov section or page name) and takes Veterans to an internal vets.gov page, such as: `/disability-benefits/conditions/ptsd/`.




**Note:** The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does not require the use of pop-up notifications for outbound links. See <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-23.pdf">M-10-23</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy2005/m05-04.pdf">M-05-04</a> for this official guidance.
