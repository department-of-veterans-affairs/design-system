## Process for creating title tags

1. Receive metas for a section of Vets.gov from SEO meta writer. Work section-by-section, following meta writer's lead/ordering/timeline.

2. Review keyword, meta description, and content for each page within a section and revise title/H tags for each page. Approach to revisions will be based on the goals in ticket #6924.  Revisions will be captured in 2 places: 1) Metas documentation (will add tags to Peggy's existing documentation) and 2) Staging (will open a PR so that changes can be reviewed in the context of page content as well).

3. Send full section's meta documentation and PR to SEO meta writer and managing editor for review. Content team will work together to finalize.

4. Send PR to next-level review.

5. Send section's PR to appropriate SME(s). SME(s) will receive a link to staging, and an explanation of the SEO changes, as an FYI. We will not ask for approval for launch, but will encourage SME(s) to review and raise any questions/concerns with us so we can address them asap.
