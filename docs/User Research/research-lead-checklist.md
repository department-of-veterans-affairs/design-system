# Research Lead Checklist: Research Projects

## Before Sessions
- [ ] 15 days out: create [planning issues](../New%20Planning%20Issue%20Template.md) in [Vets.gov team repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team) for recruitment, research, and synthesis. These should be  tagged with "research" and the relevant team's tag, as well as the researcher and other relevant parties. This serves as the project brief and basis for conversation guide.
