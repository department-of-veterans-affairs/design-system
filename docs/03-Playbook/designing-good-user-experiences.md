title: Designing Good User Experiences
---

## We are building a single unified digital experience for all Veterans.

## The challenge:

The VA customer experience is fragmented, frustrating and confusing. Customers can’t find the information they need when they need it.


| websites | 1-800 numbers |  call centers | databases |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| **1000+** | **956** | **42** | **220** |


But their wants are simple. They desire:

- Useful information that’s clearly written and presented, and;
- Tools that are easy to find and use.

The new Vets.gov intends to deliver both.

## Our goals:

- Unify and simplify VA’s digital touch points, dramatically improving customer experience
- Meet customer need on the first try, on any device
- Create a mobile-first platform
- Retool existing applications and design new end-to-end experiences, in partnership with business owners across VA
- Provide transparency about our methods and processes

## How we earn and maintain trust with Veterans (our design principles)

- Understand human need: design for people, rather than VA’s systems
  -  Our work starts and ends with Veterans
- Remember this is a quick stop in the journey
  - Minimize effort; don't create more work
  - Get Veterans to the best solution efficiently
- Assume every visitor is new
  - Accommodate new users without overburdening those with more experience
- Speak clearly, respectfully and directly
- Help people reach their goals every time
- Connect with Veterans. Create opportunities for feedback and dialog
- Research, observe, test and continuously improve
  - Learn from data to improve success rates
- Measure what matters
- Strive for maximum accessibility
  - Mobile-first approach
  - Accommodate assistive technology and cognitive differences
- Employ modern development practices – be agile
- Regard data with the utmost responsibility
