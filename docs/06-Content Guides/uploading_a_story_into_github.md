## (A Quick Guide for Writers and Truck Drivers)

You’ve been assigned a story in Pivotal to upload into GitHub. Now what?

Step 1: Download the most recent (bottom-most) version of the story. Note if
the comment states if it is back from concurrence. You’ll need that.

Step 2: Open and log into <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs>
(you will be given access from the web team). If it is your first time on GitHub, you will have to set up an account on the main site, then be added to the repository (where the files are kept), and then you’ll see it in your shared repositories.

Step 3: The story should be downloaded by now. Open the file and accept all changes in document. Highlight all of the text to be uploaded. This should be below the word “COPY” and above the line separating the “Source:” information. Copy the highlighted text.

Step 4: In GitHub, go to vets-website

Step 5 **(IMPORTANT!)**:
Where it says `Branch:master` click and a dropdown will appear. Select the branch you are working on (Jobs, Education, VR&E, etc)

Step 6: Select the folder in which your story is located.

Step 7: Find your story title. You may have to go into sub-folders within the main folder to find it. The file will have `.md` at the end of the title. If you can’t find it, ask someone for where the page is “Stubbed out”.

Step 8: Click the pencil in the upper right to edit

Step 9: Edit text. If your document is already back from concurrence (as noted in Pivotal), change “incomplete” to “complete”. Then scroll down to the text body that needs to be changed. Highlight the text to remove and paste in the new text from the document.

### STANDARD MARKDOWN YOU’LL USE:

- Links: `[The text to turn into the link goes here](www.yourlinkorinternalroutinggoeshere)` and be sure there is no space in between `](`
- On action pages, place a `###` before main segments such as “Am I eligible”, “Who”,  “Available Benefits”, and “How it works”.
- To insert italics, `*put a single asterix on either side of the segment*`
- To insert bold, `**double the asterix**`
- Additional Markdowns can be found here **[https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)**


Step 9: At the bottom of the page, ensure the correct branch is selected (NOT MASTER) and then click the button below it to create a new branch from the existing branch (it will likely say your name). It will default to the branch you selected in earlier steps. This creates a “Pull Request”. If everything is correct, type a comment for what you did to the page in the “add a comment” block and then click the green button.

Step 10: The next page will look very similar, and show you the changes you made. The green button will now say “create pull request.” Change the assignee over to the right to Shaun So and create the pull request.

Step 11: In Pivotal, assign the story to Shaun for merging, and @shaunso to let him know there is a change in the branch to merge. Copy and paste the page link (in your web browser) from GitHub from immediately after you created the pull request into the Pivotal comment so he can find it easily. After he checks it and merges it, he will assign it back to Beth or wherever it needs to go.

You just uploaded a story into GitHub! Add GitHub familiarity to your resume and you might just get upgraded to an 18-wheeler.
